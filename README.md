**Project Description:**\
Earthquakes are one of the most destructive natural disasters that can strike without warning, causing extensive damage to infrastructure, loss of life, and massive economic losses. While we cannot prevent earthquakes from occurring, the ability to accurately predict when and where they might occur could save countless lives and minimize the damage caused. Usage:The aim with this report is to contribute to the significant earthquake prediction which enables advanced warning of potentially catastrophic seismic events, allowing governments and communities to prepare and take necessary measures to minimize the impact of such events.

## Data:
The Significant Earthquake Database contains information on destructive earthquakes from 2150 B.C. to the present that meet at least one of the following criteria: Moderate damage (approximately $1 million or more), 10 or more deaths, Magnitude 7.5 or greater, Modified Mercalli Intensity X or greater, or the earthquake generated a tsunami. The database can also be displayed and extracted with the Natural Hazards Interactive Map.Installation: Report and analysis is conducted in R therefore installation of R and R studio is required. Before running the code it is necessary to ensure the datafile directory is set correctly to run the analysis and the markdown file. At the beginning of the file we have listed the selection of the libraries used, it is recommended to install the respective packages before running the analysis.

## Contributing:
The significant earthquake database poses various opportunities to optimize the risk mitigation of earthquake after-effects. However, this database alone should not be used to produce prediction models as it also contains sparse and incomplete information. Therefore, determining additional data that adds value to this extensive database could bring promising outcomes. Complementing this dataset with further inputs and other relevant variables such as population numbers and further relevant socio-economic factors may contribute to improve the future predictions in terms of estimated death and damage.
